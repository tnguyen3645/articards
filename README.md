# Articards
Articards is a simple memory and matching game for creating custom learning sessions in speech therapy. The name of the application comes from "Articulation Cards" which is a tool used in speech therapy sessions. With therapy going online because of the COVID pandemic, therapists are looking for more tools to use. Articards provides customizable learning environments by allowing users to create their own cards for the matching game. Articards also has online play, allowing students and teachers to connect over a Zoom session.

Check out Articards [here](https://articards.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. Feel free to make an account and create your own custom words and decks!
